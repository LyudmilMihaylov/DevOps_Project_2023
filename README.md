DevOps Project 2023 by Lyudmil Mihaaylov:

-In this project, I have created a DevOps environment using:

Vagrant - for VM provisioning to provision 3 Linux servers using a Vagrant File (Ruby File- for configuration)

Oracle VM Virtual Box to run the VMs

Ansible - to run a Playbook and automate the configuration of the servers

Python - PyCharm - to create a simple App

Docker - to containerise a simple Web App

Docker Swarm - to convert the servers into Docker Swarm Nodes and bring the App on the Swarm
